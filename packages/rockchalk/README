The development work on the rockchalk package
was moved to a separate GIT repository.

https://github.com/pauljohn32/rockchalk

Snapshot copies of the package are available on our test server

http://rweb.quant.ku.edu/kran

This package has no C code, so it should not be necessary
for us to build Windows "binary" versions in order for you
to test it out.  On Windows, please try

> install.packages("rockchalk", repos="http://rweb.quant.ku.edu/kran", type = "source")

I believe that should also work on Macintosh.
